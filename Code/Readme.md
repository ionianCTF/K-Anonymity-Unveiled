# k-Anonymity (Source Code)

This code provides the implementation of k-anonymity. It offers a practical implementation of k-anonymity, by using a microaggregation method for preserving data utility during anonymization and allows customization of privacy parameters, including the quasi-identifiers, k-value, and generalization intervals. Through Matplotlib visualizations, it demonstrates how different parameter choices impact the percentage of anonymized rows, aiding in the understanding of the privacy-utility trade-off. The code serves as an educational resource and provides insights into the effectiveness of these techniques for safeguarding sensitive data in research and real-world applications.
