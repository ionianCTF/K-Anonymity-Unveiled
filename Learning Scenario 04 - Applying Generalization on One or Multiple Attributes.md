# Example Workflow

## Introduction
In this learning scenario, we will explore the impact of data generalization on the anonymization process. The focus will be on applying generalization to one or multiple quasi-identifiers. Learners will specify generalization ranges and observe the effects of varying the "k" value on anonymization. By analyzing the resulting anonymized file and calculating the percentage of anonymized data, we can evaluate the balance between privacy preservation and data utility.

## Step 1: Applying Generalization to a Single Quasi-Identifier
- Begin by modifying the k-anonymity function to include generalization for a single quasi-identifier.
- Define a generalization range (e.g., age ranges) and observe the impact on the level of achieved anonymity.
- Vary the "k" value and analyze the resulting anonymized dataset to understand the trade-off between privacy and utility.

## Step 2: Analyzing Effects of Generalization and "k" Value
- Execute the modified k-anonymity function with varying generalization ranges and "k" values.
- Observe the impact of different generalization configurations on the achieved level of anonymity and data utility.
- Discuss the trade-off between privacy preservation and information loss.

## Step 3: Applying Generalization to Multiple Quasi-Identifiers
- Modify the k-anonymity function to apply generalization to two or multiple quasi-identifiers.
- Define distinct generalization ranges for each quasi-identifier.
- Adjust the "k" value accordingly and analyze the outcomes.

## Step 4: Analyzing Generalization Effects Across Multiple Attributes
- Execute the modified k-anonymity function with different combinations of generalization and "k" values.
- Compare the achieved levels of anonymity across multiple data attributes.
- Observe how different generalization ranges impact the trade-offs between privacy and data utility.

## Conclusion
Through this interactive learning scenario, participants gain insights into the impact of data generalization on the anonymization process. By applying generalization to single or multiple quasi-identifiers and varying "k" values, participants observe the trade-offs between privacy preservation and information loss. The acquired skills and knowledge enable researchers to implement generalization effectively while retaining data utility. Selecting appropriate generalization ranges and "k" values allows for a balanced approach to achieving privacy and utility in anonymized datasets.
