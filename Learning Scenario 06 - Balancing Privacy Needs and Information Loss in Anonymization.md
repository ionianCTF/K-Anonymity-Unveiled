# Example Workflow

# Learning Scenario 05: Visualization as an overview of the anonymization process.

## Introduction
In this learning scenario, we will introduce learners to the power of visualization in understanding and evaluating the k-Anonymity process. Plots will provide a visual representation of the data, offering a comprehensive overview of k-Anonymity while considering various attributes and the application of generalization. Learners will compile plots multiple times, altering attribute selections with and without generalization.

## Step 1: Visualizing the Trade-Off Between Anonymity and Information Loss
- Modify the existing `plot` function to generate plots for values of "k" ranging from 1 to 100 progressively.
- Observe how increasing the "k" value enhances anonymity but may lead to greater information loss.
- Visualize the trade-off between privacy preservation and data utility.

## Step 2: Visualizing the Influence of Attributes and Generalization
- Modify the plot function to include variations of attribute selections and generalization.
- Compile plots for different combinations of attributes and generalization intervals.
- Analyze the plots to comprehend the impact on the k-Anonymity process.

## Step 3: Analyzing Plot Outputs
- Interpret the generated plots to gauge the effectiveness of anonymization techniques.
- Assess the degree of privacy achieved and understand the implications for data utility.
- Discuss the trade-offs between privacy preservation and data utility.

## Conclusion
Through this interactive learning scenario, participants gain a visual comprehension of the k-Anonymity process. By compiling plots for different attribute selections, generalization intervals, and "k" values, learners can observe the trade-off between anonymity and information loss. The ability to interpret plots equips participants with the skills to make informed decisions when implementing k-Anonymity, considering both privacy preservation and data utility. Visualization empowers researchers to strike a balance between privacy and utility in real-world anonymization scenarios.
